# Cybersecurity-Phishing-Simulation
This repository showcases a simulated phishing workflow using Zphisher to generate deceptive login links and VirusTotal to analyze their properties. The project demonstrates how phishing links can mimic legitimate websites by comparing visual and structural similarities in a browser, helping raise awareness of digital threats. 

Tools Used:
-Kali Linux
-Zphisher
-Browser
-Virustotal
-VMware workstation

Skills Demonstrated:
- Ethical hacking methodology
- Red team simulation
- Understanding user behavior
- Security testing practices
- Linux command line usage
- VMware workstation


Observation:

Phase 1: Simulate the attack 
-Access zphisher using VMware kali linux
-Generated the link for facebook login page using zphisher
-Copy and paste the link in the email if required for further testing

note: I have not used a sample mail but used virustotal to analyze the link

Phase 2: Analyze the link
-You can view the virustotal image in the image 4 which
